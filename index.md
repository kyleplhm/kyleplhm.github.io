# Kyle Pelham - Data Analytics Portfolio

## About Me

Hi there! My name is Kyle Pelham, and I'm a current graduate student at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. I will be graduating in June of 2023 with a Master of Science in Business Analytics.

Before to grad school, I was a Marketing and Commerce Consultant at Deloitte Consulting LLP where I built out requirements and supported the implementation of Customer Data Platforms and Marketing Automation tools.

One of my strengths is my ability to communicate technical information to non-technical stakeholders in a clear and concise manner. I understand the importance of data-driven decision-making and have worked with teams across various industries to help them make informed choices.

In this portfolio, you'll find examples of data analytics projects I've worked on. Each project showcases my ability to analyze data, develop insights, and present my findings in a compelling way.

Please contact me if you have any questions!

# Data Analytics Projects:

### [1. Proactive Constraint Flow Management: Real-time Detection and Analysis for Enhanced Power Grid Stability](https://github.com/kyleplhm/Regime-Change)
* Individual contribution to a collaborative Cal Poly MSBA capstone project, partnering with a prominent North American utilities company.
* Employs the "onlineBcp" R package for real-time detection of significant shifts in power output time series data using Bayesian probabilities.
* Utilizes anonymized historical data for a single constraint, illustrating constraints as power grid limitations influenced by factors such as transmission capacity, generation limits, network topology, and regulations; constraint flow represents the electricity flow within these constrained segments.
* Identifying substantial changes in constraint flow enables utilities companies to proactively maintain grid stability during regime changes by alerting them in advance.

### [2. Chipotle Customer Segmentation: A K-means Clustering Approach to Survey Analysis](https://github.com/kyleplhm/Chipotle-Cluster-Analysis)
* Survey data cleanup: Conduct general preprocessing of survey responses to ensure data quality.
* Dimensionality reduction: Use Sci-kit Learn's PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce survey dimensions while preserving important information.
* K-means clustering: Perform k-means clustering on the transformed data using Sci-kit Learn to identify distinct customer segments.
* Cluster labeling: Apply the cluster labels to the original data for further comparative analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigate each cluster's unique characteristics and differences to better understand customer preferences and behaviors.
* Marketing strategy suggestions: Leverage insights from the cluster analysis to propose tailored marketing strategies for each customer segment.tilizes Sci-kit Learn package to reduce survey dimensions with Principle Component Analysis and perform k-means clustering on the transformed data.

### [3. Exploring the Relationship Between World Happiness and the Big Mac Index](https://github.com/kyleplhm/BigMacIndex-Happiness)
* Consolidating and processing seven years of Big Mac Index and World Happiness data into a unified dataframe for analysis.
* Conducting an exploratory data analysis to examine the potential correlation between the Big Mac Index and World Happiness scores.
* Utilizing Pearson's correlation coefficient to quantitatively assess the relationship between the two indices.

### [4. SLO Pop-Up Ordering System: Database Design and Implementation](https://github.com/kyleplhm/data-management-project)
* Eliciting requirements and establishing business rules for the development of a relational database using MySQL, tailored for a pop-up ordering system.
* Creating an advanced Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to ensure a comprehensive database structure and verifying the normalization of tables for optimal performance.
* Developing a functional prototype, including a database creation script, to facilitate rapid deployment and testing of the system.
* Effectively demonstrating the ordering workflow through a series of well-structured SQL queries and the utilization of dummy data, showcasing the system's capabilities and potential for real-world applications.
