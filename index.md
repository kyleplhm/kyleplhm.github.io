## About Me
![Kyle Picture](https://github.com/kyleplhm/kyleplhm.github.io/blob/main/kyleheadshot.jpg?raw=true)

Hi there! My name is Kyle Pelham, and I'm a current graduate student at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. I will be graduating in June of 2023 with a Master of Science in Business Analytics.

Before to grad school, I was a Marketing and Commerce Consultant at Deloitte Consulting LLP where I built out requirements and supported the implementation of Customer Data Platforms and Marketing Automation tools.

One of my strengths is my ability to communicate technical information to non-technical stakeholders in a clear and concise manner. I understand the importance of data-driven decision-making and have worked with teams across various industries to help them make informed choices.

In this portfolio, you'll find examples of data analytics projects I've worked on. Each project showcases my ability to analyze data, develop insights, and present my findings in a compelling way.

Please contact me if you have any questions!

# Data Analytics Projects:

### [1. Proactive Constraint Flow Management: Real-time Detection and Analysis for Enhanced Power Grid Stability](https://github.com/kyleplhm/Regime-Change)
* Individual contribution to a collaborative Cal Poly MSBA capstone project, partnering with a prominent North American utilities company.
* Employs the "onlineBcp" R package for real-time detection of significant shifts in power output time series data using Bayesian probabilities.
* Utilizes anonymized historical data for a single constraint, illustrating constraints as power grid limitations influenced by factors such as transmission capacity, generation limits, network topology, and regulations; constraint flow represents the electricity flow within these constrained segments.
* Identifying substantial changes in constraint flow enables utilities companies to proactively maintain grid stability during regime changes by alerting them in advance.
