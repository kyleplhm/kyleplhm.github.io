Hi there! My name is Kyle Pelham, and I'm a graduate student at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. I will be graduating in June of 2023 with a Master of Science in Business Analytics.

Before to grad school, I was a Marketing and Commerce Consultant at Deloitte Consulting LLP where I built out requirements and supported the implementation of Customer Data Platforms and Marketing Automation tools.

One of my strengths is my ability to communicate technical information to non-technical stakeholders in a clear and concise manner. I understand the importance of data-driven decision-making and have worked with teams across various industries to help them make informed choices.

In this portfolio, you'll find examples of data analytics projects I've worked on. Each project showcases my ability to analyze data, develop insights, and present my findings in a compelling way.

Please contact me if you have any questions!
